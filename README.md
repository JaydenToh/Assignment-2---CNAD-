## üìå Project Description

**Problem Statement By Lion Befrienders**  
Many seniors are susceptible to falls due to illnesses such as weakness in legs, sarcopenia, deterioration  
in eyesight etc. Currently, assessment for fall risk is usually carried out by healthcare professionals and  
may remain undiscovered till seniors decide to seek healthcare assistance.

How might we use Technology to offer an easy and user-friendly way for seniors to perform  
preliminary self-assessment in the comfort of their own homes, with vulnerable cases being  
highlighted for further clinical assessment by doctors?

## üìù Overview

This project is a cloud-native microservices-based system designed to help seniors assess their fall risk from the comfort of their homes. It consists of multiple microservices running in containers, orchestrated using Kubernetes.

**üí° Our Solution**  
A comprehensive platform featuring:  
üîπ1. Modularity and Scalability  
We adopted a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific domain or functionality, making it easier to maintain, update, and scale individual components without affecting the entire system.

üîπ2. User Experience and Accessibility  
Our website is designed with a user-friendly interface, taking into account the needs of elderly users. We aimed to create an intuitive and accessible experience, with clear navigation, simple language, and minimal cognitive load.

üîπ 3. Data Security and Privacy  
We implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive user data, including encryption, secure authentication, and authorization. Our solution complies with relevant data protection regulations and guidelines.

üîπ4. Interoperability and Integration  
Our microservices are designed to communicate with each other seamlessly, using standardized APIs and data formats. This enables easy integration with other healthcare systems, services, or devices.

üîπ5. Reliability and Fault Tolerance  
We implemented redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability. Our solution can detect and recover from failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service.

### **Design Considerations of the Proposed Microservices Architecture**

1. **Microservices Separation**

   - **Domain-Driven Boundaries**: Each core domain (e.g., User Management, Assessment, Notification, Exercise, Clinic, DVT) is developed as an individual microservice, allowing teams to work independently and deploy updates without affecting other services.
   - **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate primarily via REST APIs, reducing direct dependencies and making it easier to replace or update services with minimal impact on the overall system.

2. **Scalability & Resilience**

   - **Containerization**: Every microservice is encapsulated in its own Docker container, ensuring a consistent runtime environment and simplifying deployments.
   - **Kubernetes Orchestration**: The system leverages Kubernetes for automated scaling and load balancing. If demand spikes for any one microservice (e.g., the Assessment service), Kubernetes can quickly provision additional containers.

3. **Data Management & Storage**

   - **Dedicated Database Layer**: Each microservice (e.g., Notification, User Management) has access to its own database or shared database schema as needed. This prevents cross-service data conflicts and ensures data integrity.
   - **SQL & NoSQL**: A combination of relational (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) may be used, based on each service‚Äôs data requirements and transaction patterns.
   - **Security & Compliance**: Sensitive information, such as user credentials and health data, is encrypted at rest and in transit to adhere to best practices and potential regulatory requirements.

4. **API Gateway (Optional)**

   - **Request Routing & Security**: An optional API gateway can manage cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate-limiting, and request forwarding. This centralization simplifies service-to-service communication and external access to internal microservices.

5. **User Experience & Frontend**

   - **Dedicated Frontend Microservice**: The React-based UI runs in its own container, communicating with the backend via well-defined APIs. This reduces coupling between the UI and backend logic, enabling independent updates.
   - **Accessibility & Senior-Centric Design**: The UI prioritizes large text, clear navigation, and simplified language to cater to seniors who need an easy-to-use interface for self-assessment and preventive measures.

6. **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**

   - **Health Checks & Monitoring**: Kubernetes performs automatic health checks on containerized services, restarting any that fail. Logging and monitoring tools are in place to detect and analyze issues quickly.
   - **Redundancy & Auto-Scaling**: Critical services (e.g., User Management, Notification) can be replicated and scaled horizontally to minimize downtime and latency.

7. **Security & Authorization**

   - **Authentication Mechanisms**: The User Management service handles secure login and signup, storing credentials in a protected database and managing sessions or tokens.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Certain functionalities (e.g., editing user data, booking clinic appointments) may require specific privileges, ensuring the correct level of access.

8. **Extensibility & Future Integrations**

   - **Standardized APIs**: Using RESTful endpoints and standardized data formats (JSON) enables interoperability with external systems (e.g., clinic databases, third-party health APIs).
   - **Plug-and-Play Services**: New services (e.g., advanced fall-risk analytics, additional quiz modules) can be added to the architecture with minimal friction, thanks to the microservices approach and containerization.

9. **Deployment & CI/CD**

   - **Automated Builds & Testing**: Docker images and microservice code are built and tested in a continuous integration pipeline, preventing regressions and ensuring code reliability.
   - **Rapid Updates & Rollbacks**: Rolling updates on Kubernetes allow microservices to be upgraded with no downtime. In case of issues, the cluster can quickly roll back to a stable version.

10. **Elderly-Focused Functionality**
    - **Clinic Video Management**: Simplifies clinic searches and potential appointment booking, closing the loop between self-assessment and professional consultation.
    - **Exercise Management**: Recommends senior-friendly physical activities to reduce the risk of falls and maintain overall health.
    - **DVT & Eye Assessments**: Provides specialized quizzes to identify possible conditions contributing to falls or health complications.

By adhering to these design considerations, the system delivers a robust, secure, and user-friendly application aimed at helping seniors assess and reduce their fall risk, while remaining flexible enough to evolve with future healthcare innovations.

# üöÄ Installation Guide

Get your project up and running in a few simple steps!

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Docker** (Download: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/))
- **Docker Compose** (Usually bundled with Docker Desktop)
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** to run the `.sql` files for Notification and User Management microservices

_(Optional if you wish to develop locally without Docker)_

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm** (v9+ recommended)
- **Git**

---

# üìå Quick Start with Docker (All Microservices)

1. **Ensure Docker Desktop is running** on your machine.
2. **Clone** this repository to your local system.
3. **Run the database SQL files in SSMS (if using local MS SQL)**:
   - Locate the SQL scripts from **Notification Management** and **User Management** microservices.
   - Execute these scripts in your SQL Server (or equivalent setup) so that the necessary tables are created.
4. **Build and launch** all microservices together:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
5. **That‚Äôs it!** Docker will spin up the frontend and all backend microservices.

_(If you only need to run them in detached mode, add `-d`: `docker-compose up --build -d`.)_

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Optional Steps for Local Development

### Frontend (Local)

```bash
# 1) Navigate to the frontend folder
cd your-repo/frontend

# 2) Install dependencies
npm install

# 3) Run the development server
npm run dev
```

(This will start the React app on a local dev server.)

### Backend (Local)

```bash
# 1) Open a new terminal window and navigate to the backend folder
cd your-repo/backend

# 2) Install dependencies
npm install

# 3) Start the backend server
node server.js
```

You can open multiple terminals if you want to run different microservices separately under the `backend` directory.

---

## üê≥ Stopping the Services

- **Docker**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- **Local Node.js**: Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal where `node server.js` is running.

---

### Common Issues & Fixes

- **Port Already in Use**

  ```bash
  npx kill-port 3000
  ```

  Then re-run your server.

- **MySQL Connection Refused**  
  Make sure the MySQL container or local DB is up:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

  If MySQL is not running, start it:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d mysql
  ```

- **ENV File Not Loaded**
  ```bash
  npm install dotenv
  ```
  Then at the top of `app.js`:
  ```js
  require("dotenv").config();
  ```

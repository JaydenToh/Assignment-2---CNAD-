## üìå Project Description

**Problem Statement By Lion Befrienders**
Many seniors are susceptible to falls due to illnesses such as weakness in legs, sarcopenia, deterioration
in eyesight etc. Currently, assessment for fall risk is usually carried out by healthcare professionals and
may remain undiscovered till seniors decide to seek healthcare assistance.

How might we use Technology to offer an easy and user-friendly way for seniors to perform
preliminary self-assessment in the comfort of their own homes, with vulnerable cases being
highlighted for further clinical assessment by doctors?

## üìù Overview
This project is a cloud-native microservices-based system designed to help seniors assess their fall risk from the comfort of their homes. It consists of multiple microservices running in containers, orchestrated using Kubernetes.

** üí° Our Solution**  
A comprehensive platform featuring:  
üîπ1. Modularity and Scalability
We adopted a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific domain or functionality, making it easier to maintain, update, and scale individual components without affecting the entire system.

üîπ2. User Experience and Accessibility
Our website is designed with a user-friendly interface, taking into account the needs of elderly users. We aimed to create an intuitive and accessible experience, with clear navigation, simple language, and minimal cognitive load.

üîπ 3. Data Security and Privacy
We implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive user data, including encryption, secure authentication, and authorization. Our solution complies with relevant data protection regulations and guidelines.

üîπ4. Interoperability and Integration
Our microservices are designed to communicate with each other seamlessly, using standardized APIs and data formats. This enables easy integration with other healthcare systems, services, or devices.

üîπ5. Reliability and Fault Tolerance
We implemented redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and reliability. Our solution can detect and recover from failures, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous service.

# üìå Group Project: Backend Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the backend of this project, including installing dependencies, running the server, and using Docker.

---

## üöÄ Project Setup Instructions

### üìå Step 1: Open a New Terminal Window
Ensure you have the required software installed:
- **Node.js** (Download: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (Comes with Node.js)
- **Docker** (Download: [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/))

---

### üìå Step 2: Navigate to the Backend Directory
Move into the backend project folder using:
```sh
cd your-repo/backend
```
Make sure you are in the correct directory before proceeding.

### üìå Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
This will install all necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

### üìå Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and configure your environment variables:
```sh
touch .env
```
Inside `.env`, add the following variables:
```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=notification

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=youremail@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=yourpassword

# Application Port
PORT=3000
```
Update `yourpassword` and other values as needed.

### üìå Step 5: Start the Backend Server
#### Option 1: Run Directly with Node.js
To start the server manually, run:
```sh
npm start
```
If your server runs successfully, you should see:
```plaintext
Server is running on port 3000
```
#### Option 2: Run with Docker
If using Docker, start the services with:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will run the backend in a Docker container.

To stop the services, use:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

### üìå Step 6: Verify the API
After starting the server, test it by visiting:
- **API Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Example Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/notifications`

#### To test with Postman, use:
- `GET http://localhost:3000/notifications` ‚Üí Fetch all notifications
- `POST http://localhost:3000/notifications` ‚Üí Add a new notification
- `PUT http://localhost:3000/notifications/:id` ‚Üí Update an existing notification
- `DELETE http://localhost:3000/notifications/:id` ‚Üí Remove a notification

### üìå Step 7: Common Issues & Fixes
#### ‚ùå Port 3000 Already in Use
If you see an error like:
```plaintext
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```
Fix it by stopping the process using port 3000:
```sh
npx kill-port 3000
```

#### ‚ùå MySQL Connection Refused
If MySQL isn‚Äôt connecting, ensure the database service is running:
```sh
docker ps
```
If MySQL is not listed, restart it with:
```sh
docker-compose up -d mysql
```

#### ‚ùå ENV File Not Loaded
If the application fails to load `.env` variables, install dotenv:
```sh
npm install dotenv
```
Then, add this line at the top of `app.js`:
```js
require("dotenv").config();
```

### üìå Step 8: How to Contribute
1. Pull the latest code from the repository:
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and test them locally.
4. Commit and push your code:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
5. Create a pull request (PR) for review.

### üìå Step 9: Stop the Server
To stop the backend server:
```sh
Ctrl + C
```
To stop the Docker container:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

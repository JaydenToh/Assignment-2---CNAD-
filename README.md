## 📌 Project Description

**Problem Statement By Lion Befrienders**
Many seniors are susceptible to falls due to illnesses such as weakness in legs, sarcopenia, deterioration
in eyesight etc. Currently, assessment for fall risk is usually carried out by healthcare professionals and
may remain undiscovered till seniors decide to seek healthcare assistance.

preliminary self-assessment in the comfort of their own homes, with vulnerable cases being
highlighted for further clinical assessment by doctors?
